Install the car software on a Raspberry Pi and set up the device to provide a WiFi hotspot. The client software on your Computer then connects to this hotspot and sends steering commands to the RPi.</br>
When the RPi receives those commands, it sets GPIO-pins accordingly to pass the commands on to the Lego Racer's original remote control, which then controls the car.</br>
A colored glove should be worn so that hand gestures are properly recognized. A tool to choose the glove's color is provided.</br>
Alternatively you can control the car and view the livestream via <a href="http://github.com/Masrepus/Fifty50Cardboard">Fifty50 Cardboard App</a> for Google Cardboard.
